Question 1
You're a designer of a virtual farming simulation. In this game, a farmer needs to plant and harvest crops in
different plots of land. Each plot can grow only one type of crop at a time. The game generates random weather
events that can affect the growth of crops. The player who harvests the most crops by the end of the season wins.
Design an appropriate solution involving optimal data structure design and corresponding operations. 
Calculate the time complexity and justify your choice of implementation and data structure with adequate 
explanation.



Question 2
You are designing a city simulation game where players can build and manage their own city. Each player can 
place buildings, manage resources, and handle citizens. The game generates random events like fires or floods 
that players must respond to. The player who has the most prosperous city by the end of the game wins. Design a 
solution involving optimal data structure design and corresponding operations. Calculate the time complexity and
justify your choice of implementation and data structure with adequate explanation.
 
 
 
Question 3
In a maze exploration game, players are tasked with finding their way out of a randomly generated maze. Each 
player starts at a different location and must find the exit. The maze contains various obstacles and treasures 
that players can collect along the way. The player who finds the exit in the shortest time wins. Design an 
appropriate solution involving optimal data structure design and corresponding operations. 
Calculate the time complexity and justify your choice of implementation and data structure with adequate 
explanation.
 
 
 
 
Question 4
You're developing a space exploration game where players pilot spaceships to explore different planets. Each 
planet has its own set of challenges and resources. Players can gather resources, upgrade their ships, and 
encounter random space events. The player who explores the most planets and gathers the most resources wins. 
Design a solution involving optimal data structure design and corresponding operations. 
Calculate the time complexity and justify your choice of implementation and data structure with adequate
explanation.
 
 
 
 
Question 5
In a survival simulation game, players must gather resources, build shelters, and fend off wild animals. 
The game generates random weather and animal encounters. The player who survives the longest wins. 
Design an appropriate solution involving optimal data structure design and corresponding operations.
Calculate the time complexity and justify your choice of implementation and data structure with adequate 
explanation.
 
 
 
 
Question 6
You're designing a trading card game where players collect cards, build decks, and compete against each other. 
Each card has unique attributes and abilities. The game generates random card packs for players to collect and 
trade. The player who builds the most powerful deck and wins the most matches is the champion. 
Design a solution involving optimal data structure design and corresponding operations. 
Calculate the time complexity and justify your choice of implementation and data structure with adequate 
explanation.
