# 🧠 [Algorithm/Technique Name]: The Playbook

This guide breaks down **[Algorithm/Technique Name]** into its essence — concept, implementation, problem patterns, and practical examples — so you can master it with confidence.

---

## 🧐 Concept

At its heart, **[Algorithm/Technique Name]** is a method for **[briefly describe the main purpose in one clear sentence]**.

Think of it like **[insert a simple, relatable real-world analogy]**.  
For example: If you’re trying to guess a number between 1 and 100, you wouldn’t try every number one by one. You’d make a guess, get feedback (too high / too low), and eliminate large chunks of possibilities each time.

**Key Idea:** The core principle is to **[state the fundamental logical approach — e.g., “reduce the problem space iteratively” / “build the solution incrementally using optimal choices” / “combine partial solutions to solve the whole”]**.

* **Time Complexity**: `O( ... )`
* **Space Complexity**: `O( ... )`
* **Typical Input Constraints**: Handles up to `...` elements / `...` operations effectively.

## 💻 Implementation

Below is a generic implementation template in Python (adapt as needed for other languages).

### Generic Code

```python
# [Path to actual implementation in your repository]
# Example: ./Algorithm_Name/algorithm_name.py

def algorithm_name(params):
    """
    Generic implementation of [Algorithm/Technique Name].
    """
    # Step 1: Initialize necessary variables / data structures
    ...

    # Step 2: Main loop / recursion / processing logic
    while condition:
        ...
        # Decision / state update
        ...

    # Step 3: Return result
    return result
````

* **Input**: `...`
* **Goal**: `...`

| Step | State / Variables | Decision Made | Action Taken |
| :--- | :---------------- | :------------ | :----------- |
| 1    | ...               | ...           | ...          |
| 2    | ...               | ...           | ...          |
| 3    | ...               | ...           | ...          |
| ...  | ...               | ...           | ...          |

* **Output**: `...`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Pattern Recognition

Knowing **when** to use this technique is as important as knowing **how** to code it.
Look for these tell-tale signs in a problem:

* **Input properties suggest efficiency potential** — e.g., sorted data, monotonic relationships, special constraints.
* **Can reduce possibilities quickly** — if a single check lets you eliminate a large portion of cases.
* **Decision-making has a clear structure** — problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems that follow the same rules.
* **Optimization goals** — finding the smallest/largest value meeting a condition (“search on answer”).
* **Monotonicity or ordering** — output/condition changes in a predictable way with input.

## 🎯 Solved Problems & Applications

The best way to master a technique is to **apply it**. Here are some example problem types where **\[Algorithm/Technique Name]** shines:

* **Problem 1**: [Name](./Solved_Problems/problem1.md)

  * **Pattern**: Explain the key reason why this technique applies here.

* **Problem 2**: [Name](./Solved_Problems/problem2.md)

  * **Pattern**: Note the unique twist and how the algorithm adapts.

* **Problem 3**: [Name](./Solved_Problems/problem3.md)

  * **Pattern**: Demonstrates the “boundary finding” or “optimization” flavor of the technique.

## 🔍 Pro Tips

* Always check if the **preconditions** for this technique are satisfied before using it.
* Understand **edge cases** — e.g., empty inputs, duplicates, extreme values.
* Start with a **simple brute-force solution** to verify correctness before optimizing with this algorithm.
* Write helper functions for repeated logic to keep the main implementation clean.
* When in doubt, **dry-run** with a small example before coding.
