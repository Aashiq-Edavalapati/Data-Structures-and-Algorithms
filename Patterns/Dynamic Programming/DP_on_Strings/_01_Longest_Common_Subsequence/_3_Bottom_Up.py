    @question:
        Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

        A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

        For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
        A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
        
        Example 1:
            Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
            Output: 3  
            Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Example 2:
            Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Example 3:
            Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
            Output: 0
            Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Constraints:
            1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
            text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
