    @question:
        Given an array arr of n integers and an integer diff, count the number of ways to partition the array into two subsets S1 and S2 such that:

        |S1| - |S2| = diff and S1 â‰¥ S2
        Where |S1| and |S2| are sum of Subsets S1 and S2 respectively.

        Return the result modulo 1e9 + 7.


        Examples:

            Input: arr = [1, 1, 2, 3], diff = 1
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The subsets are [1, 2] and [1, 3], [1, 3] and [1, 2], [1, 1, 2] and [3].
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], diff = 2
            Output: 2
            Explanation: The subsets are [1, 3] and [2, 4], [1, 2, 3] and [4].
        
        Constraints:
            1 <= n <= 200
            0 <= d <= 104
            0 <= arr[i] <= 50

    @intuition:
        1. S1 + S2 = sum(arr)
        2. S1 - S2 = diff => S2 = S1 - diff
        3. => Substitute in 1: 
                S1 + S1 - diff = sum(arr)
            => S1 = (sum(arr) + diff) // 2

        i.e., if we find if there exists a partition in the array whose elements sum to S1 as derived, then automatically the remaining elements sum to S2.

        Therefore, the question boils down to counting the partition in the array with sum S1.
