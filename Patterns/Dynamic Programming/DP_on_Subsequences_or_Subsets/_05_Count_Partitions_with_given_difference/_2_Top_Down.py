    @question:
        Given an array arr of n integers and an integer diff, count the number of ways to partition the array into two subsets S1 and S2 such that:

        |S1| - |S2| = diff and S1 â‰¥ S2
        Where |S1| and |S2| are sum of Subsets S1 and S2 respectively.

        Return the result modulo 1e9 + 7.


        Examples:

            Input: arr = [1, 1, 2, 3], diff = 1
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The subsets are [1, 2] and [1, 3], [1, 3] and [1, 2], [1, 1, 2] and [3].
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], diff = 2
            Output: 2
            Explanation: The subsets are [1, 3] and [2, 4], [1, 2, 3] and [4].
        
        Constraints:
            1 <= n <= 200
            0 <= d <= 104
            0 <= arr[i] <= 50
