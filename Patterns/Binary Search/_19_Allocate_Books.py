# Problem: Allocate Books
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# @question:
#   You are given an array `arr` where arr[i] is the number of pages in the i-th book,
#   and an integer `students` which is the number of students.
#   You must allocate books in order (no rearranging), so that each student
#   gets at least one book, and the maximum number of pages assigned
#   to any student is as small as possible.
#
#   Return the minimum possible value of the maximum pages a student has to read.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @pattern: Binary Search on Answer
#   - We are not searching inside the array, but for the "minimum maximum pages".
#   - Monotonicity: If books can be allocated with `maxPages` limit,
#     then any larger limit also works. If it cannot be done with `maxPages`,
#     then any smaller limit also fails.
#   - This monotonic property allows us to apply binary search.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @method (easy steps):
#   1. Minimum possible pages = max(arr), because one student must read
#      at least the thickest book.
#   2. Maximum possible pages = sum(arr), if only one student gets all the books.
#   3. Binary search between [max(arr), sum(arr)]:
#       - For a mid value, check how many students are needed
#         if no student is allowed to read more than `mid` pages.
#       - If the number of students needed > given students â†’ increase `left`.
#       - Otherwise, move `right` down to try smaller maximum pages.
#   4. At the end, `left` gives the smallest possible maximum pages.
#
# Time Complexity: O(N log(sum(arr) - max(arr)))
# Space Complexity: O(1)
