# Problem: Aggressive Cows
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# @question:
#   We are given the positions of stalls (arr) and the number of cows (cows).
#   We want to place all cows in the stalls so that the minimum distance
#   between any two cows is as large as possible.
#
#   Return the largest minimum distance possible.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @pattern: Binary Search on Answer
#   - We are not searching inside the array directly.
#   - We search for the maximum distance (answer) that still allows placing all cows.
#   - Monotonic property:
#       If a distance `d` is possible, then all distances smaller than `d` are possible too.
#       If a distance `d` is not possible, then all distances larger than `d` are also impossible.
#   - This monotonicity â†’ Binary Search on Answer.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @method (easy steps):
#   1. Sort stall positions.
#   2. Minimum possible distance = 1, maximum = last_stall - first_stall.
#   3. Binary search on this distance range:
#       - Check if we can place all cows with at least `mid` distance.
#       - If yes, try bigger distance (move left pointer up).
#       - If no, try smaller distance (move right pointer down).
#   4. The maximum valid distance will be stored in `right`.
#
# Time Complexity: O(N log(max_distance))
#   - For each distance checked, we try placing cows (O(N)).
#   - Distances are checked with binary search.
# Space Complexity: O(1)
