# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) — Pattern-Driven Mastery

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms** repository! 🚀

This repo is built for ambitious learners, interview aspirants, and curious minds who want to conquer algorithmic challenges—not by memorizing solutions, but by understanding patterns and strengthening intuition.

---

##  Why This Repo Exists

Technical interview rounds often test your ability to recognize patterns and apply the right strategy, not just recall code. This repository aims to bridge that gap by helping you:

- **Understand**, not memorize
- **Identify** recurring patterns in problems
- **Build intuition** that scales across diverse scenarios
- **Master the mindset** required to solve confidently and creatively

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aashiq-Edavalapati/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
    ```
2. Install Python (if not already).
3. Explore by topic:
   - Need help with **two-pointer problems**? Head to `Patterns/Two-Pointer/`.
   - Craving insight into **dynamic programming**? Explore `Patterns/Dynamic-Programming/`.
   - Looking to practice coding for sorting, trees, or arrays? Visit `Algorithms/`, `Data Structures/`, or `Problems/`.

##  How to Use This Repo

- Start with a problem category that challenges you.
- Examine the code solution and pattern outline in the corresponding folder.
- Ask yourself:
  - What pattern is this embodying?
  - Why does it work?
  - Could this approach apply elsewhere?
- Try variations or related challenges to reinforce your understanding.
